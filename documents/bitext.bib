abstract = {In recent years a number of studies have analysed the player transfer market in English professional football. This paper examines whether similar factors operate to determine transfer fees in the semiprofessional, or nonleague, game. An empirical model of the nonleague player transfer market is developed in which observed transfer fees are determined by player characteristics, time effects, selling-club characteristics and buying-club characteristics. Using data on 114 transfer fees covering the period 1988 to 1997, we find evidence that the data generating process for transfer fees is broadly similar in both professional and nonleague football.},

  abstract={This article studies the transfer market for international football players. Analyzing a sample of 5,760 player transfers over 14 years, we provide evidence that clubs in English football pay larger transfer fee premiums compared to clubs in the top leagues of France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. While the popular press often mentions the English premiums, we empirically demonstrate both their existence and their causal source. Using annual data, we show that the dramatic increase in English premiums is causally linked to the 2012 television contracts the EPL signed with domestic and international broadcasters. These findings have policy implications for the clubs, players, and governing bodies of European football, as well as indirect consequences for export‐oriented football clubs.},

abstract="Sports analytics is a field that is growing in popularity and application throughout the world. One of the open problems in this field is the valuation of football players. The aim of this study is to establish a football player value assessment model using machine learning techniques to support transfer decisions of football clubs. The proposed models will mainly be based on the intrinsic features of the individual players which are provided in Football Manager video game. To do this, based on the individual statistics of 5316 players who are active in 11 different major leagues from Europe and South America, different value assessment models are conducted using advanced supervised learning techniques like ridge and lasso regressions, random forests and extreme gradient boosting. All the models have been built in R programming language. The performances of the models are compared based on their mean squared errors. An ensemble model with inflation is proposed as the output.",

abstract = {Every year a huge amount of money is invested by the football clubs in the transfer window period to hire or release players. Estimating players’ value in the transfer market is a crucial task for the managers of the clubs. Also, it is one of the attractive aspects of football for fans. Tranfermarkt.com is a reference website that determines the transfer fee of the players based on its members’ opinions. The limitation of this website has attracted the attention of data scientists in recent years, resulting in creating datasets and data-driven estimating methods. In this paper, a novel method for estimating the value of players in the transfer market, based on the FIFA 20 dataset, is proposed. The proposed method has two phases. In the first phase, the dataset is clustered using an automatic clustering method called APSO-clustering. This automatic clustering method, which can detect the proper number of clusters, has divided the dataset into 4 clusters automatically indicating the position of the players: goalkeepers, midfielders, defenders, and strikers. In the second phase, a hybrid regression method which is a combination of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector regression (SVR), is used to build a prediction model for each clusters’ data points. In this hybrid method, PSO is used for feature selection and parameter tuning of SVR. The achieved results show that the proposed method can estimate the players’ value with an accuracy of 74\%. Comparing the performance of PSO with 3 other metaheuristics, the results demonstrated the superiority of PSO over GWO, IPO, and WOA.},
